Scope and status of dualfermion 
===============================


Scope
-------------

The current program calculates the second order dual fermion self-energy for multi-band/multi-orbital systems.

The program aims to expose all relevant internal objects via python, so that no file based interaction is needed.

Status
-------------

The program is still under development and parts of the interface are likely to change.
Not implemented are diagrams beyond second order, (inner) self-consistency, two-particle quantities, etc.
No parallelization is currently implemented.
Tests have been performed for several moderately complicated systems. If you are studying a new system, please do check if the results are reasonable.
